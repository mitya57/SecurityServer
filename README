TODO
====

1. Split model definition from other access control statements; load
policy from several files.

2. Generalize access path parameters. Prepared SQL should be augmented
with list of parameters, and path evaluation function should accespt a
name/value mapping representing current request.

3. Implement parameterized roles.
